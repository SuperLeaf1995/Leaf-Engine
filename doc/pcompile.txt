COMPILE FOR DOS (TURBO C)
========================================================================

- Get TurboC

- Inside the TC folder, create a new folder named SRC, here is where you
will put the myprg.c, leaf.lib and myprg.prj files

- Get leaf.h and leaf.lib, place leaf.lib in SRC, and leaf.h in INCLUDE

- Create a myprg.c (or any desired name) file, then add some stuff
on it

- Create a *.prj file, with the following data:
leaf.lib
myprg.c

- Save and close the file, open the TurboC's IDE (TC.EXE) in DOSBox

- Make sure the TC folder is a subfolder of the root (i.e: TC is a
subfolder of Desktop, and Desktop is mounted as C:, so the TC folder
looks like this: C:\TC in DOSBox, this prevents some funny stuff to
happen)

- Change directory to SRC

- Load file "myprg.c"

- Options > Project Name > myprg.prj

- Compile > Build all

- If everything succeded, you may be able to run the application and
call leaf functions without problems

COMPILE FOR DOS (BORLAND TURBO C++)
========================================================================

- Get Borland TurboC++

- Inside the TC++ folder, create a new folder named SRC, here is where you
will put the myprg.c, leaf.lib and myprg.prj files

- Get leaf.h and leaf.lib, place leaf.lib in LIB, and leaf.h in INCLUDE

- Link leaf.lib with cs.lib:

tlib cs.lib +leaf.lib

- Create a myprg.c (or any desired name) file, then add some stuff
on it

- Create a *.prj file, with the following data:
leaf.lib
myprg.c

- Save and close the file, open the TurboC++'s IDE (TC.EXE) in DOSBox

- Make sure the TC++ folder is a subfolder of the root (i.e: TC++ is a
subfolder of Desktop, and Desktop is mounted as C:, so the TC++ folder
looks like this: C:\TCPP in DOSBox, this prevents some funny stuff to
happen)

- Change directory to SRC

- Load file "myprg.c"

- Options > Project Name > myprg.prj

- Compile > Build all

- If everything succeded, you may be able to run the application and
call leaf functions without problems

COMPILE FOR LINUX
========================================================================

- Get gcc and make

sudo apt-get install gcc make build-essential

- Get leaf.h and libleaf.a (static) or libleaf.so (shared) and place
the header in /usr/include, and libleaf.* in /usr/lib

- Create a myprg.c (or any desired name) file, then add some stuff
on it

- Run the following:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -lleaf myprg.c -o myprg.o

- If everything succeded, you may be able to run the application and
call leaf functions without problems

COMPILE FOR FREEBSD
========================================================================

- Get leaf.h and libleaf.a (static) or libleaf.so (shared) and place
the header in /usr/include, and libleaf.* in /usr/lib

- Create a myprg.c (or any desired name) file, then add some stuff
on it

- Run the following:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -lleaf myprg.c -o myprg.o

- If everything succeded, you may be able to run the application and
call leaf functions without problems

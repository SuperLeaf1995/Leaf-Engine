COMPILE FOR DOS (TURBO C)
========================================================================

- Get TurboC

- Create a SRC directory inside TurboC

- Put LEAF in SRC

- Due to a bug in TurboC's MAKE, run the following command before running
the main make:
make -fMakefile.tc2

- Run the main makefile to create the project:
make -fMakefile.tc

- To install, do the following:
make -fMakefile.tc install

* Note: The Makefile assumes TurboC is installed in TC\ folder

COMPILE FOR LINUX (GCC)
========================================================================

- Get GCC

- Run the following:
make -f Makefile.gcc linux-shared
or
make -f Makefile.gcc linux-static

- To install, run the following:
sudo make -f Makefile.gcc install-linux-shared
or
sudo make -f Makefile.gcc install-linux-static

* Note: Installation of includes and libs happens in /usr/include and
/usr/lib respectively
* If you receive "Undefined function XYZ", try to include the library as
a object (i.e gcc mygame.c -o mygame.o /usr/lib/libleaf.a)

COMPILE FOR FREEBSD (GCC)
========================================================================

- Get GCC

- Run the following:
make -f Makefile.gcc linux-shared
or
make -f Makefile.gcc linux-static

- To install, run the following:
sudo make -f Makefile.gcc install-linux-shared
or
sudo make -f Makefile.gcc install-linux-static

* Note: Installation of includes and libs happens in /usr/include and
/usr/lib respectively
* If you receive "Undefined function XYZ", try to include the library as
a object (i.e gcc mygame.c -o mygame.o /usr/lib/libleaf.a)

COMPILE FOR GAMEBOY ADVANCE (GCC-CROSS)
========================================================================

- Get GCC cross compiler (arm-none-eabi)

- Run the following:
make -f Makefile.gcc gba

- You will have a static library (out/gba) wich can be linked with your
GBA game

* Note: Makefile assumes GCC cross compiler is in opt/ directory
* Note: Requires a glibc or equivalent
